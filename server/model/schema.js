///Created schema for storing banking details
// point to be noted..
// In the real world, we shouldnâ€™t store `floats` for balances in the database.
// we usually store an integer which represents the INR value with
// decimal places (for eg, if someone has 33.33 rs in their account,
// you store 3333 in the database).
// There is a certain precision that you need to support (which for india is
// 2/4 decimal places) and this allows you to get rid of precision errors by storing integers in your DB
//this IRL we can only send our friend 99.24 or 99 and not 99.234 or so on.
// in db it will be stored as 9924
//Have created another file named inrSchema just to understand how the code is written, however it is not implemented right now..
